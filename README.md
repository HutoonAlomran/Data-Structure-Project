# Efficient Storage of Vehicle Locations for Vehicle Hiring Applications
 
<!-- introduction -->
## About The Project
### Introduction
Vehicle hiring companies such as Uber, Careem, and Jeeny rely on fast localization of available vehicles near potential customers. Such efficient localization requires specialized data structures, and the goal of this project is to implement and use one such data structure
### Storing vehicles locations
Vehicles and customers are localized using GPS devices available in mobile phones, and these devices determine
the longitude and latitude coordinates as floating-point numbers. To simplify the task, however, we will divide the
geographical area under consideration into small cells and use integers to identify each location on the map (see Figure
1).
